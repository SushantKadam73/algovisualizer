# Longest Common Subsequence Algorithm Visualizer.

### About the project:
This project was made upon the request of Dr. Ayser Armiti as a final project of Design and Analysis of Algorithms (
10671210 ) course in [Computer-Science Apprenticeship Program](https://www.najah.edu/en/academic/undergraduate-programs/program/computer-science-apprenticeship-program/info-card/) at [An-Najah National University](http://www.najah.edu/).

### Method and Complexity:
This visualizer uses the [Tabulation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tabulation-vs-memoization/) method of [Dynamic Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/) (Bottom-Up) to find the LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) between two texts.
The Complexity of this algorithm using the Bottom-Up approach is O(m*n) where m and n are the lengths of the first and second texts.
